### About the Experiment 

Genetic Algorithms are a form of Artificial Intelligence. They learn by evolving a fit set of solution to previously specified problem. The fundamental idea behind genetic algorithms is the same idea behind Darwinian evolution, survival of the fittest. Each potential solution to a problem in a genetic algorithm is represented by one individual. The fitter individuals are allowed to breed more often. By allowing fitter individuals to breed more often, the population tends toward the desired solution with time. This ability to tend towards a solution is comparable to reasoning capability.
